# Bacteria Growth Model

The simulation uses OOP to model the growth of a bacteria and culture medium in a limited space using cellular automata with periodic boundaries and von Neumannâ€™s neighbors. The simulation's parameters, variables, rules, and assumptions are discussed in the PDF.

The code for the model and experiments are in the Jupyter Notebook.
