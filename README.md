The following simulation models the growth of a bacteria and culture medium in a limited space using cellular automata with periodic boundaries and von Neumannâ€™s neighbors. The parameters, variables, rules, and assumptions of the simulation are discussed in the PDF.

The code for the model and experiments are in the jupyter notebook.
